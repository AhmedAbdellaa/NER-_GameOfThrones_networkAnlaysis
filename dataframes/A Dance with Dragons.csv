meat.Had he sunk so low as to hunger after human meat?He could

man is an abomination.”,
Abomination.",['Haggon'],['haggon']

Varamyr when he was ten.A name �t for a lord, a name for songs, a
mighty name, and fearsome.","['Varamyr\nSixskins', 'Mance Rayder', 'Varamyr']","['mance', 'varamyr']"

frightened rabbit.The terrible Lord Varamyr had gone craven, but

spearwife that his name was Haggon.","['Varamyr', 'Haggon']","['varamyr', 'haggon']"

Bridge of Skulls and take the Shadow Tower.","['Milkwater', 'Weeper']",['weeper']

knew that he would never live to see it.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']

run or die.
Death was not so easily outrun, however.“His mother,”, Thistle told him later, after the boy had run

her …”,

pierced his �esh.","['Thistle', 'Varamyr']","['thistle', 'varamyr']"

pain …

wash of blood as he brought forth a stillborn cub.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']

and nights had passed and Thistle had not returned.","['Haggon', 'Thistle']","['haggon', 'thistle']"
"“Wait,”, she’d said.She won’t be
coming back.Varamyr wondered if he had given himself away.
Could she tell what he was thinking just from looking at him, or

Abomination, he heard Haggon saying.","['Varamyr', 'Haggon']","['varamyr', 'haggon']"

father slapped him and told him to be quiet.",['Haggon'],['haggon']

right hand of Mance Rayder.",['Mance Rayder'],['mance']

never had, but he had come close.Varamyr Sixskins was a name

the seep of blood from his wound, Varamyr lurched to the door and
swept aside the ragged skin that covered it to face a wall of white.
Snow.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']
"No wonder it had grown so dark and smoky inside.The
falling snow had buried the hut.
When Varamyr pushed at it, the snow crumbled and gave way,
still soft and wet.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']

vast white wilderness where nothing moved except the blowing
snow.“Thistle,”, Varamyr called feebly, wondering how far she
could have gone.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']

Far away, a wolf gave howl.
A shiver went through Varamyr.He knew that howl as well as
Lump had once known his mother’s voice.","['Varamyr', 'Lump']",['varamyr']
"The old wolf was fearless, relentless, savage.
Varamyr had lost control of his other beasts in the agony of the
eagle’s death.His shadowcat had raced into the woods, whilst his
snow bear turned her claws on those around her, ripping apart four
men before falling to a spear.","['wolf', 'Varamyr']",['varamyr']

come within her reach.The bear hated him, had raged each time he
wore her skin or climbed upon her back.

“You take one, that’s a marriage.The wolf is part of you from that
day on, and you’re part of him.",['Haggon'],['haggon']

hold with such.“Some skins you never want to wear, boy.You
won’t like what you’d become.”, Birds were the worst, to hear him
tell it.","['Haggon', 'Birds']",['haggon']
"Even in their
own skins, they sit moony, staring up at the bloody blue.”,
Not all skinchangers felt the same, however.Once, when Lump
was ten, Haggon had taken him to a gathering of such.","['Lump', 'Haggon']",['haggon']

were the most numerous in that company, the wolf-brothers, but

Thistle, he thought.
Haggon would call it an abomination, the blackest sin of all, but

enough to take her.
A wave of dizziness washed over Varamyr.He found himself upon
his knees, his hands buried in a snowdrift.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']
"Leaning heavily upon it, he staggered toward the nearest
hut.Perhaps the villagers had forgotten something when they
�ed  …  a sack of apples, some dried meat, anything to keep him
alive until Thistle returned.

"He was almost there when his crutch snapped beneath his weight,
and his legs went out from under him.
How long he sprawled there with his blood reddening the snow
Varamyr could not have said.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']
"The snow will bury me.It would be a
peaceful death.They say you feel warm near the end, warm and sleepy.
“The world beyond
the Wall is not for our kind,”, Haggon used to say.",['Haggon'],['haggon']
"“The free folk
fear skinchangers, but they honor us as well.South of the Wall, the
kneelers hunt us down and butcher us like pigs.”,
You warned me, Varamyr thought, but it was you who showed me
Eastwatch too.","['kneelers', 'Varamyr', 'Eastwatch']",['varamyr']
"Eastwatch was
a better place to trade than Castle Black; that was where the ships
came, laden with goods from the fabled lands beyond the sea.The
crows knew Haggon as a hunter and a friend to the Night’s Watch,
and welcomed the news he brought of life beyond their Wall.","['Eastwatch', 'Castle Black', 'Haggon', 'the Night’s Watch']",['haggon']
"Varamyr could feel the snow�akes melting on his brow.This is not
so bad as burning.Let me sleep and never wake, let me begin my second
life.His wolves were close now.","['Varamyr', 'second']",['varamyr']
"Which, though?
Not Sly.Haggon would have called it abomination, but Varamyr
had often slipped inside her skin as she was being mounted by One
Eye.He did not want to spend his new life as a bitch, though, not
unless he had no other choice.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']
"Stalker might suit him better, the
younger male … though One Eye was larger and �ercer, and it was
One Eye who took Sly whenever she went into heat.
“They say you forget,”, Haggon had told him, a few weeks before
his own death.",['Haggon'],['haggon']
"Orell had been slain by the turncloak crow Jon Snow, and
his hate for his killer had been so strong that Varamyr found himself
hating the beastling boy as well.","['Orell', 'Jon Snow', 'Varamyr']","['orell', 'jon', 'varamyr']"
",
Varamyr knew the truth of that.When he claimed the eagle that
had been Orell’s, he could feel the other skinchanger raging at his
presence.He had known what Snow was the
moment he saw that great white direwolf stalking silent at his side.
","['Varamyr', 'Orell’s', 'Snow']","['varamyr', 'orell']"

but the youth was untaught, still �ghting his nature when he should
have gloried in it.
Varamyr could see the weirwood’s red eyes staring down at him
from the white trunk.","['Snow', 'Varamyr']",['varamyr']
"He could feel ice forming in his beard.Varamyr Sixskins closed
his eyes.
He dreamt an old dream of a hovel by the sea, three dogs
whimpering, a woman’s tears.

"His mother waited
until he was almost four to give him a proper name, and by then it
was too late.The whole village had taken to calling him Lump, the
name his sister Meha had given him when he was still in their
mother’s belly.","['Lump', 'Meha']",['meha']
"Meha had given Bump his name as well, but Lump’s
little brother had been born in his proper time, big and red and
robust, sucking greedily at Mother’s teats.","['Lump', 'Mother’s']",['mother']

thought he meant to put him down the same way he had done the
dogs.Instead he’d given him to Haggon.

loose.“Get up,”, she screamed again, “they’re coming.”,

was shaking him, shouting in his face.",['Thistle'],['thistle']
"Varamyr could smell her
breath and feel the warmth of it upon cheeks gone numb with cold.
Now, he thought, do it now, or die.
He summoned all the strength still in him, leapt out of his own
skin, and forced himself inside her.

strength of this young body before her teeth snapped together and
�lled his mouth with blood.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']
"A horned
owl �ew silently between his trees, hunting a hare; Varamyr was
inside the owl, inside the hare, inside the trees.Deep below the
frozen ground, earthworms burrowed blindly in the dark, and he
was them as well.",['Varamyr'],['varamyr']

remembered, and a part of him grieved for what he had lost and
another part for what he’d done.",['Thistle'],['thistle']

moved.",['Hodor'],['hodor']

beneath the snow.

at the neck, and for half a moment he exulted … until a pair of dead

formidable as a loose stool.","['Yezzan', 'Yunkish']",['yezzan']
