"PROLOGUE
“We should start back,”, Gared urged as the woods began to grow
dark around them.
“The wildlings are dead.”,
“Do the dead frighten you?”, Ser Waymar Royce asked with just
the hint of a smile.
","['Gared', 'Ser Waymar Royce']","['gared', 'waymar']"
"Gared did not rise to the bait.He was an old man, past �fty, and
he had seen the lordlings come and go.“Dead is dead,”, he said.“We
have no business with the dead.”,
“Are they dead?”, Royce asked softly.",['Royce'],['royce']
"“What proof have we?”,
“Will saw them,”, Gared said.“If he says they are dead, that’s
proof enough for me.”,
Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or
later.",['Gared'],['gared']
"He wished it had been later rather than sooner.“My mother
told me that dead men sing no songs,”, he put in.
“My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,”, Royce replied.",['Royce'],['royce']
"“We have a long ride before us,”, Gared pointed out.“Eight days,
maybe nine.And night is falling.”,
Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest.",['Gared'],['gared']
"“It does
that every day about this time.Are you unmanned by the dark,
Gared?”,
Will could see the tightness around Gared’s mouth, the barely
suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak.
",['Gared'],['gared']
"Mounted on his huge black
destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller
garrons.Ser Waymar had been
a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch for less than half a year, but
no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation.","['Waymar', 'Sworn', 'the Night’s Watch']",['waymar']
"“Bet he killed them all himself, he did,”, Gared told the
barracks over wine, “twisted their little heads o�, our mighty
warrior.”, They had all shared the laugh.
",['Gared'],['gared']
"Gared must have
felt the same.
“Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,”, Gared said.
“They’re dead.They shan’t trouble us no more.There’s hard riding
before us.",['Gared'],['gared']
"No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, and it
had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.
“The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a
stream,”, Will said.",['Will'],['will']
"“Did you make note of the position of the bodies?”,
Will shrugged.“A couple are sitting up against the rock.Most of
them on the ground.Fallen, like.”,
“Or sleeping,”, Royce suggested.
",['Royce'],['royce']
"“You have a chill?”, Royce asked.
“Some,”, Will muttered.“The wind, m’lord.”,
The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms.Frost-
fallen leaves whispered past them, and Royce’s destrier moved
restlessly.","['Royce', 'Will', 'Royce’s']","['royce', 'will', 'royce']"
"“What do you think might have killed these men,
Gared?”, Ser Waymar asked casually.He adjusted the drape of his
long sable cloak.
“It was the cold,”, Gared said with iron certainty.","['Gared', 'Ser Waymar', 'Gared']","['gared', 'waymar', 'gared']"
"“I never
suspected you had it in you.”,
“I’ve had the cold in me too, lordling.”, Gared pulled back his
hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look at the stumps where his
ears had been.","['Gared', 'Ser Waymar']","['gared', 'waymar']"
"Peaceful, like.”,
“Such eloquence, Gared,”, Ser Waymar observed.“Two ears, three toes, and the little �nger o� my left
hand.I got o� light.We found my brother frozen at his watch, with
a smile on his face.”","['Gared', 'Ser Waymar']","['gared', 'waymar']"
",
Ser Waymar shrugged.“You ought dress more warmly, Gared.”,
Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes
�ushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears
away.","['Ser Waymar', 'Gared', 'Gared', 'Maester Aemon']","['waymar', 'gared', 'gared']"
"“We’ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.”,
He pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and
sullen.
“If Gared said it was the cold …”, Will began.
","['Gared', 'Will']","['gared', 'will']"
"“Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?”,
“Yes, m’lord.”, There never was a week when he did not draw a
dozen bloody watches.What was the man driving at?
",['Will'],['will']
"“And how did you �nd the Wall?”,
“Weeping,”, Will said, frowning.He saw it clear enough, now that
the lordling had pointed it out.“They couldn’t have froze.",['Will'],['will']
"Not if the
Wall was weeping.It wasn’t cold enough.”,
Royce nodded.“Bright lad.We’ve had a few light frosts this past
week, and a quick �urry of snow now and then, but surely no cold
�erce enough to kill eight grown men.","['Royce', 'We’ve']",['royce']
"The stars began to come
out.A half-moon rose.Will was grateful for the light.
“We can make a better pace than this, surely,”, Royce said when
the moon was full risen.
",['Royce'],['royce']
"“Not with this horse,”, Will said.Fear had made him insolent.
“Perhaps my lord would care to take the lead?”,
Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply.
",['Will'],['will']
"Somewhereo� in the wood a wolf howled.
Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood
and dismounted.
“Why are you stopping?”, Ser Waymar asked.
",['Ser Waymar'],['waymar']
"“Best go the rest of the way on foot, m’lord.It’s just over that
ridge.”,
Royce paused a moment, staring o� into the distance, his face
re�ective.A cold wind whispered through the trees.","['m’lord', 'Royce']","['mord', 'royce']"
"His great sable
cloak stirred behind like something half-alive.
“There’s something wrong here,”, Gared muttered.
The young knight gave him a disdainful smile.",['Gared'],['gared']
"“Is there?”,
“Can’t you feel it?”, Gared asked.“Listen to the darkness.”,
Will could feel it.Four years in the Night’s Watch, and he had
never been so afraid.",['Gared'],['gared']
"What was it?
“Wind.Trees rustling.A wolf.Which sound is it that unmans you
so, Gared?”, When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from
his saddle.","['Gared', 'Gared', 'Royce']","['gared', 'gared', 'royce']"
"It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-
made from the look of it.Will doubted it had ever been swung in
anger.
“The trees press close here,”, Will warned.",['Will'],['will']
"“That sword will tangle
you up, m’lord.Better a knife.”,
“If I need instruction, I will ask for it,”, the young lord said.
“Gared, stay here.Guard the horses.”,
Gared dismounted.","['Gared', 'Gared']","['gared', 'gared']"
"“We need a �re.I’ll see to it.”,
“How big a fool are you, old man?If there are enemies in this
wood, a �re is the last thing we want.”,
“There’s some enemies a �re will keep away,”, Gared said.",['Gared'],['gared']
"“Bears
and direwolves and … and other things …”,
Ser Waymar’s mouth became a hard line.“No �re.”,
Gared’s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard
glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight.","['Gared', 'Will']","['gared', 'will']"
"thing, its grip discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use,
but Will would not have given an iron bob for the lordling’s life if
Gared pulled it from its scabbard.
",['Gared'],['gared']
"“Something’s wrong.”,
Royce did not move.He looked down at the empty clearing and
laughed.“Your dead men seem to have moved camp, Will.”,
Will’s voice abandoned him.",['Royce'],['royce']
"A
valuable weapon …
“On your feet, Will,”, Ser Waymar commanded.“There’s no one
here.I won’t have you hiding under a bush.”,
Reluctantly, Will obeyed.
","['Ser Waymar', 'bush']",['waymar']
"Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval.“I am not
going back to Castle Black a failure on my �rst ranging.We will �nd
these men.”, He glanced around.","['Ser Waymar', 'Castle Black']",['waymar']
"Perhaps he was wrong.Perhaps it had only
been a bird, a re�ection on the snow, some trick of the moonlight.
What had he seen, after all?
“Will, where are you?”, Ser Waymar called up.",['Ser Waymar'],['waymar']
"A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood.It stood in front of
Royce.Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with �esh pale
as milk.The patterns ran like
moonlight on water with every step it took.
",['Royce'],['royce']
"Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss.
“Come no farther,”, the lordling warned.His voice cracked like a
boy’s.He threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders, to free
his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands.",['Ser Waymar Royce'],['waymar']
"The wind had
stopped.It was very cold.
The Other slid forward on silent feet.In its hand was a longsword
like none that Will had ever seen.No human metal had gone into
the forging of that blade.",['Will'],['will']
"It steamed in the cold, and
the droplets seemed red as �re where they touched the snow.Ser
Waymar’s �ngers brushed his side.His moleskin glove came away
soaked with red.
",['Waymar'],['waymar']
"“For Robert!”, he shouted, and
he came up snarling, lifting the frost-covered longsword with both
hands and swinging it around in a �at sidearm slash with all his
weight behind it.",['Robert'],['robert']
"Will knelt,
looked around warily, and snatched it up.The broken sword would
be his proof.Gared would know what to make of it, and if not him,
then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester Aemon.","['Will knelt', 'Mormont', 'Maester Aemon']","['will', 'mormont']"
"Would Gared
still be waiting with the horses?He had to hurry.
Will rose.Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.
His �ne clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin.",['Waymar Royce'],['waymar']
"The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills.
Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder,
the King-beyond-the-Wall.",['Mance Rayder'],['mance']
"It made Bran’s skin prickle to think of it.
He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them.The wildlings
were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves.","['Bran’s', 'Old Nan']",['old']
"Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their
horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older
than seven, trying to pretend that he’d seen all this before.","['Jon', 'Bran']",['jon']
"Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy
brought forth the sword.“Ice,”, that sword was called.It was as
wide across as a man’s hand, and taller even than Robb.","['Eddard Stark', 'Theon Greyjoy']","['eddard', 'theon']"
"The blade
was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke.Nothing held an
edge like Valyrian steel.
His father peeled o� his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel,
the captain of his household guard.","['Valyrian', 'Valyrian', 'Jory Cassel']",['jory']
"He took hold of Ice with both
hands and said, “In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the
First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First
Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by
the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and
Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die.”, He lifted the
greatsword high above his head.
","['Robert', 'the House Baratheon', 'First', 'Rhoynar', 'First', 'the Seven Kingdoms', 'Realm', 'Eddard of the House Stark', 'Winterfell', 'Warden of the North']","['robert', 'eddard']"
"Bran’s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer.“Keep the pony
well in hand,”, he whispered.“And don’t look away.Father will
know if you do.”,
Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.
","['Jon Snow', 'Bran']",['jon']
"“Ass,”, Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear.He put
a hand on Bran’s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard
brother.“You did well,”, Jon told him solemnly.","['Jon', 'Greyjoy', 'Bran’s', 'Bran', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"
"Jon was fourteen,
an old hand at justice.
It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the
wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky.","['Jon', 'Winterfell']",['jon']
"He was big and broad and
growing every day, with his mother’s coloring, the fair skin, red-
brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun.“He had
courage, at the least.”,
“No,”, Jon Snow said quietly.",['Jon Snow'],['jon']
"“It was not courage.This one was
dead of fear.You could see it in his eyes, Stark.”, Jon’s eyes were a
grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did
not see.","['Stark', 'Jon']",['jon']
"He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike.
Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was
fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.
",['Jon'],['jon']
"Robb was not impressed.“The Others take his eyes,”, he swore.
“He died well.Race you to the bridge?”,
“Done,”, Jon said, kicking his horse forward.Robb cursed and
followed, and they galloped o� down the trail, Robb laughing and
hooting, Jon silent and intent.","['Jon', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"
"“Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon
says he was afraid.”,
“What do you think?”, his father asked.
Bran thought about it.“Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?”,
“That is the only time a man can be brave,”, his father told him.
",['Jon'],['jon']
"But you mistake me.The question was not why the
man had to die, but why I must do it.”,
Bran had no answer for that.“King Robert has a headsman,”, he
said, uncertainly.
",['Robert'],['robert']
"And if you cannot bear to do that, then
perhaps the man does not deserve to die.
“One day, Bran, you will be Robb’s bannerman, holding a keep of
your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to
you.",['Robb’s'],['robb']
"When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task,
but neither must you look away.A ruler who hides behind paid
executioners soon forgets what death is.”,
That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before
them.",['Jon'],['jon']
"“Come, let us see what
mischief my sons have rooted out now.”, He sent his horse into a
trot.Jory and Bran and the rest came after.
They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon
still mounted beside him.","['Bran', 'Jon']",['jon']
"The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping
for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground.Jory Cassel and
Theon Greyjoy were the �rst to reach the boys.","['Jory Cassel', 'Theon Greyjoy']","['jory', 'theon']"
"Bran jumped o� and ran.
By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well.
“What in the seven hells is it?”, Greyjoy was saying.
“A wolf,”, Robb told him.
","['Theon Greyjoy', 'Greyjoy']",['theon']
"But it was the size of it that made him gasp.It was bigger than his
pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father’s kennel.
“It’s no freak,”, Jon said calmly.",['Jon'],['jon']
"“That’s a direwolf.They grow
larger than the other kind.”,
Theon Greyjoy said, “There’s not been a direwolf sighted south of
the Wall in two hundred years.”,
“I see one now,”, Jon replied.
","['Theon Greyjoy', 'Jon']","['theon', 'jon']"
"“You
can touch him.”,
Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon
said, “Here you go.”, His half brother put a second pup into his
arms.","['Jon', 'second']",['jon']
"“Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,”, muttered
Hullen, the master of horse.“I like it not.”,
“It is a sign,”, Jory said.
Father frowned.","['Hullen', 'Jory']","['hullen', 'jory']"
"“This is only a dead animal, Jory,”, he said.Yet
he seemed troubled.Snow crunched under his boots as he moved
around the body.“Do we know what killed her?”,
“There’s something in the throat,”, Robb told him, proud to have
found the answer before his father even asked.",['Jory'],['jory']
"“Maybe she didn’t,”, Jory said.“I’ve heard tales  …  maybe the
bitch was already dead when the pups came.”,
“Born with the dead,”, another man put in.“Worse luck.”,
",['Jory'],['jory']
"“No matter,”, said Hullen.“They be dead soon enough too.”,
Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.
“The sooner the better,”, Theon Greyjoy agreed.He drew his
sword.","['Hullen', 'Bran', 'Theon Greyjoy']","['hullen', 'theon']"
"For a moment he
sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would
someday be.“We will keep these pups.”,
“You cannot do that, boy,”, said Harwin, who was Hullen’s son.
","['Harwin', 'Hullen’s']","['harwin', 'hullen']"
"“It be a mercy to kill them,”, Hullen said.
Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a
furrowed brow.“Hullen speaks truly, son.",['Hullen'],['hullen']
"Robb resisted stubbornly.“Ser Rodrik’s red bitch whelped again
last week,”, he said.“It was a small litter, only two live pups.She’ll
have milk enough.”,
“She’ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.”,
“Lord Stark,”, Jon said.","['Rodrik', 'Stark', 'Jon']","['rodrik', 'jon']"
"It was strange to hear him call Father that,
so formal.Bran looked at him with desperate hope.“There are �ve
pups,”, he told Father.“Three male, two female.”,
“What of it, Jon?”,
“You have �ve trueborn children,”, Jon said.","['Jon', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"
"He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment.Even at
seven, Bran understood what his brother had done.The count had
come right only because Jon had omitted himself.","['Jon', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"
"He had included
the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who
bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to
all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of
their own.
","['Rickon', 'Snow']",['rickon']
"Their father understood as well.“You want no pup for yourself,
Jon?”, he asked softly.
“The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,”, Jon pointed
out.","['Jon', 'House Stark', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"
"“I am no Stark, Father.”,
Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully.Robb rushed into the
silence he left.“I will nurse him myself, Father,”, he promised.","['Stark', 'Jon']",['jon']
"“We won’t let them die.”,
“Keep them, then.Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups.It’s
time we were back to Winterfell.”,
It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran
allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory.","['Desmond', 'Winterfell', 'Bran']",['desmond']
"By then, his pup
was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the
long ride home.Bran was wondering what to name him.
Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.
","['Halfway', 'Jon']",['jon']
"“What is it, Jon?”, their lord father asked.
“Can’t you hear it?”,
Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves
on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but","['Jon', 'Bran']",['jon']
"Jon
was listening to something else.
“There,”, Jon said.He swung his horse around and galloped back
across the bridge.They watched him dismount where the direwolf
lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel.",['Jon'],['jon']
"A moment later he was
riding back to them, smiling.
“He must have crawled away from the others,”, Jon said.
“Or been driven away,”, their father said, looking at the sixth pup.
","['Jon', 'sixth']",['jon']
"“An albino,”, Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement.“This one
will die even faster than the others.”,
Jon Snow gave his father’s ward a long, chilling look.","['Theon Greyjoy', 'Jon Snow']","['theon', 'jon']"
"“I think
not, Greyjoy,”, he said.“This one belongs to me.”,
CATELYN
Catelyn had never liked this godswood.
She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the
Red Fork of the Trident.","['Greyjoy', 'Tully', 'Riverrun', 'Trident']",['tully']
"But she knew she would �nd her husband here tonight.Whenever
he took a man’s life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the
godswood.
Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the
rainbow of light that �lled the sept of Riverrun.","['Catelyn', 'Riverrun']",['catelyn']
"For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to
the seven faces of god, but the blood of the First Men still �owed in
the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the
nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the
vanished children of the forest.
","['Ned', 'First', 'Starks']",['ned']
"Worship was for the sept.
At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a
small pool where the waters were black and cold.“The heart tree,”,
Ned called it.",['Ned'],['ned']
"She could feel
the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them.“Arya is
already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is
not quite sure.”,
“Is he afraid?”, Ned asked.
","['Sansa', 'Rickon', 'Ned']","['sansa', 'rickon', 'ned']"
"“A little,”, she admitted.“He is only three.”,
Ned frowned.“He must learn to face his fears.He will not be
three forever.And winter is coming.”,
“Yes,”, Catelyn agreed.","['Ned', 'Catelyn']","['ned', 'catelyn']"
"All but
the Starks.Winter is coming, said the Stark words.Not for the �rst
time, she re�ected on what a strange people these northerners
were.
“The man died well, I’ll give him that,”, Ned said.","['Starks', 'Stark', 'Ned']",['ned']
"You would have been proud of Bran.”,
“I am always proud of Bran,”, Catelyn replied, watching the sword
as he stroked it.She could see the rippling deep within the steel,
where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in
the forging.",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']
"Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny
that Ice had its own beauty.Four hundred
years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged.","['Catelyn', 'Ice']",['catelyn']
"The name it
bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the
Starks were Kings in the North.
“He was the fourth this year,”, Ned said grimly.","['North', 'Ned']",['ned']
"It’s not
only desertions.They are losing men on rangings as well.”,
“Is it the wildlings?”, she asked.
“Who else?”, Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of
it.",['Ned'],['ned']
"have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with
this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.”,
“Beyond the Wall?”, The thought made Catelyn shudder.
",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']
"“And it will only grow worse.The day may come when I will
Ned saw the dread on her face.“Mance Rayder is nothing for us
to fear.”His smile was gentle.“You listen to too many of Old Nan’s
stories.","['Ned', 'Old Nan’s']","['ned', 'old']"
"The Others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone
eight thousand years.Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived
at all.No living man has ever seen one.”,
“Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf
either,”, Catelyn reminded him.
","['Maester Luwin', 'Catelyn']",['catelyn']
"“I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,”, he said with
a rueful smile.He slid Ice back into its sheath.“You did not come
here to tell me crib tales.",['Tully'],['tully']
"I know how little you like this place.
What is it, my lady?”,
Catelyn took her husband’s hand.“There was grievous news
today, my lord.I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed
yourself.”, There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him
straight.",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']
"“I am so sorry, my love.Jon Arryn is dead.”,
His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as
she had known it would.In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie,
and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and
his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon.","['Jon Arryn', 'Ned', 'Eyrie', 'Arryn', 'second', 'Robert Baratheon']","['jon', 'ned', 'arryn', 'robert']"
"And one day �fteen years ago, this second father had become a
brother as well, as he and Ned stood together in the sept at
Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully.
","['second', 'Ned', 'Hoster Tully']","['ned', 'hoster']"
"“Jon …”, he said.“Is this news certain?”,
“It was the king’s seal, and the letter is in Robert’s own hand.I
saved it for you.He said Lord Arryn was taken quickly.","['Robert', 'Arryn']","['robert', 'arryn']"
"Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy,
so Jon did not linger long in pain.”,
“That is some small mercy, I suppose,”, he said.","['Maester Pycelle', 'Jon']",['jon']
"Even
She could see the
grief on his face, but even then he thought �rst of her.“Your
sister,”, he said.“And Jon’s boy.What word of them?”,
“The message said only that they were well, and had returned to
the Eyrie,”, Catelyn said.","['Jon', 'Eyrie', 'Catelyn']","['jon', 'catelyn']"
"“I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead.
The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband’s place,
not hers.Lord Jon’s memory will haunt each stone.","['Eyrie', 'Jon']",['jon']
"I know my
sister.She needs the comfort of family and friends around her.”,
“Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not?Jon named him

Catelyn nodded.","['Vale', 'Knight of the Gate', 'Catelyn nodded']","['knight', 'catelyn']"

the boy.That is some comfort, but still …”,

noise and shouts and laughter.","['Brynden', 'Ned']","['brynden', 'ned']"
"That boy of hers needs other children
about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.”,
“Would that I could,”, Catelyn said.“The letter had other tidings.
",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']
"The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out.”,
It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the
understanding came, the darkness left his eyes.","['Winterfell', 'Ned']",['ned']
"“Robert is coming
here?”, When she nodded, a smile broke across his face.
Catelyn wished she could share his joy.But she had heard the talk
in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its
throat.",['Robert'],['robert']
"“We should send word to
your brother on the Wall.”,
“Yes, of course,”, he agreed.“Ben will want to be here.I shall tell
Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird.”, Ned rose and pulled her to
her feet.","['Maester Luwin', 'Ned']",['ned']
"“Damnation, how many years has it been?And he gives us
no more notice than this?Cersei and the children
travel with them.”,
“Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,”, he said.",['Robert'],['robert']
"“It is just
as well.That will give us more time to prepare.”,

consent to that.She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would
be welcome here as well.”,

"Fostering the boy elsewhere
would be a grievous a�ront to him.”,
“I have more concern for my nephew’s welfare than I do for
Lannister pride,”, Ned declared.
","['Lannister', 'Ned']",['ned']
"Lord
Tywin has already given his consent.“That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.”, Robert
laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the
vaulted ceiling.","['Lannister', 'Robert']",['robert']
"His smile was a �ash of white teeth in the thicket of
the huge black beard.“Ah, Ned,”, he said, “you are still too serious.”,
He put a massive arm around Ned’s shoulders.",['Ned'],['ned']
"Blind stone eyes
seemed to follow them as they passed.The king kept his arm
around Ned’s shoulder.“You must have wondered why I �nally
came north to Winterfell, after so long.”,
Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice.","['Winterfell', 'Ned']",['ned']
"The Night’s Watch is a shadow of what it
once was.Benjen says—”,
“No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,”,
Robert said.“The Wall has stood for what, eight thousand years?","['Benjen', 'Robert']","['benjen', 'robert']"
"It
can keep a few days more.I have more pressing concerns.These are
di�cult times.I need good men about me.Men like Jon Arryn.He
served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand of
the King.","['Jon Arryn', 'Eyrie', 'Warden of the East']",['jon']

said brusquely.“No more.”,
That took Ned by surprise.","['Ned', 'Eyrie', 'Robert', 'Ned']","['ned', 'robert', 'ned']"
"He stopped, startled, and turned to
look at his king.The words came unbidden.“The Arryns have
always been Wardens of the East.The title goes with the domain.”,
“Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to
him,”, Robert said.","['Wardens', 'East', 'Robert']",['robert']
"“I have this year to think of, and next.A six-year-
old boy is no war leader, Ned.”,
“In peace, the title is only an honor.Let the boy keep it.For his
father’s sake if not his own.",['Ned'],['ned']
"Surely you owe Jon that much for his
service.”,
The king was not pleased.He took his arm from around Ned’s
shoulders.“Jon’s service was the duty he owed his liege lord.","['Jon', 'Ned']","['jon', 'ned']"
"I am
not ungrateful, Ned.You of all men ought to know that.But the son
is not the father.A mere boy cannot hold the east.”, Then his tone
softened.“Enough of this.",['Ned'],['ned']
"There is a more important o�ce to
discuss, and I would not argue with you.”, Robert grasped Ned by
the elbow.“I have need of you, Ned.”,
“I am yours to command, Your Grace.","['Robert', 'Ned', 'Ned', 'Grace']","['robert', 'ned', 'ned']"

he had to say, and so he said them, apprehensive about what might
come next.
Robert scarcely seemed to hear him.“Those years we spent in the
Eyrie … gods, those were good years.","['Robert', 'Eyrie']",['robert']
"I want you down in King’s Landing, not up here at the end of
the world where you are no damned use to anybody.”, Robert
looked o� into the darkness, for a moment as melancholy as a
Stark.","['King’s Landing', 'Robert', 'Stark']",['robert']

Ned.“I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder
than winning one.Laws are a tedious business and counting coppers
is worse.",['Ned'],['ned']

better.I am surrounded by �atterers and fools.It can drive a man to
madness, Ned.Half of them don’t dare tell me the truth, and the
other half can’t �nd it.",['Ned'],['ned']
"There are nights I wish we had lost at the
Trident.Ah, no, not truly, but …”,

my old friend.”, He smiled.","['Trident', 'Ned', 'Robert']","['ned', 'robert']"

to dispense king’s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or
otherwise indisposed.Robert was o�ering him a responsibility as
large as the realm itself.

honor you, I’d let you retire.",['Robert'],['robert']
"“You know
the saying, about the king and his Hand?”,
Ned knew the saying.“What the king dreams,”, he said, “the Hand
builds.”,

choicer way to put it.",['Ned'],['ned']
"Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped.Ned was still on one
knee, his eyes upraised.“Damn it, Ned,”, the king complained.“You
might at least humor me with a smile.”","['Ned', 'Ned']","['ned', 'ned']"
",
“They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man’s laughter
freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,”, Ned said evenly.
“Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.”,
“Come south with me, and I’ll teach you how to laugh again,”, the
king promised.","['Ned', 'Starks']",['ned']

marriage can wait a few years.”, The king smiled.“Now stand up
and say yes, curse you.”,

answered.","['Robert', 'Grace', 'Ned']","['robert', 'ned']"

king reached down, clasped Ned by the hand, and pulled him
roughly to his feet.","['Catelyn', 'Ned']","['catelyn', 'ned']"

have some time to consider?“Just don’t keep me waiting too long.I am not

foreboding.",['Eddard Stark'],['eddard']

There were times—not many, but a few—when Jon Snow was glad
he was a bastard.As he �lled his wine cup once more from a
passing �agon, it struck him that this might be one of them.

delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he
drained a glass.",['Jon'],['jon']

stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt.
He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the
king’s o�spring.",['Jon'],['jon']

they made their entrance.The procession had passed not a foot
from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon had gotten
a good long look at them all.

"His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her
seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him.Even at
fourteen, Jon could see through her smile.

"Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm.
The king was a great disappointment to Jon.His father had talked
of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident,

only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his

long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster.","['Jon', 'Rickon']","['jon', 'rickon']"

brother’s side.",['Jon'],['jon']

white fur.The direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand,

quiet wolf,”, he observed.

tonight.”,

angry too,”, Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice.“Father took the

here.Come on.That’s it.”“Shy,

at the dwarf.","['Lannister', 'Jon']",['jon']

him to.I’ve been training him.”,

actually true yet, but it would be.

his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his
mismatched eyes.",['Jon'],['jon']

either.It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone.
","['Luwin', 'Lady Catelyn']","['luwin', 'catelyn']"
"May I approach?”,
Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak.The maester placed the
paper on the table beside the bed.It was sealed with a small blob of
blue wax.",['Catelyn nodded'],['catelyn']
"Luwin bowed and began to retreat.
“Stay,”, Ned commanded him.His voice was grave.He looked at
Catelyn.“What is it?My lady, you’re shaking.”,

can feel it.”,

Catelyn broke the seal.
Her eyes moved over the words.At �rst they made no sense to
her.Then she remembered.“Lysa took no chances.When we were
girls together, we had a private language, she and I.”,
“Can you read it?”,
“Yes,”, Catelyn admitted.

“Perhaps I should withdraw,”, Maester Luwin said.
“No,”, Catelyn said.“We will need your counsel.”, She threw back
the furs and climbed from the bed.","['Maester Luwin', 'Catelyn']",['catelyn']
"The night air was as cold as the
grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room.
Maester Luwin averted his eyes.Even Ned looked shocked.“What
are you doing?”, he asked.
","['Maester Luwin', 'Ned']",['ned']
"“Lighting a �re,”, Catelyn told him.She found a dressing gown
and shrugged into it, then knelt over the cold hearth.
“Maester Luwin—”, Ned began.

feet.",['Ned'],['ned']

“Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.”,
His �ngers tightened on her arm.“By whom?”,

Ned released his hold on her arm.","['Jon Arryn', 'Ned']","['jon', 'ned']"
"“She knows,”, Catelyn said.“Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this
message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden.She knew it meant
death if her letter fell into the wrong hands.",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']
"To risk so much, she
must have had more than mere suspicion.”, Catelyn looked to her
husband.“Now we truly have no choice.You must be Robert’s
Hand.You must go south with him and learn the truth.”,
She saw at once that Ned had reached a very di�erent conclusion.

of his throat.",['Luwin'],['luwin']

"Would you leave your
brother surrounded by Lannisters?”,
“The Others take both of you,”, Ned muttered darkly.He turned
away from them and went to the window.",['Ned'],['ned']

did the maester.They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent
farewell to the home he loved.When he turned away from the

"Was this to be her punishment?Never to see
his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?

found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most
dreaded.","['Maester Luwin', 'Catelyn']",['catelyn']

Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to
his.“Rickon is very young,”, he said gently.“He should stay here
with you and Robb.",['Ned'],['ned']

“I could not bear it,”, Catelyn said, trembling.
“You must,”, he said.“Sansa must wed Jo�rey, that is clear now,
we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion.","['Catelyn', 'Jo�rey']",['catelyn']

Winterfell.","['Arya', 'Ned', 'Winterfell']","['arya', 'ned']"

became mine.",['Robert'],['robert']

you, my lady,”, he whispered.“This is hard, I know.”,

","['Ned', 'Maester Luwin']",['ned']

her, and pulled away.

knowledge.","['Catelyn', 'Catelyn']","['catelyn', 'catelyn']"

spent that year apart, Ned o� at war in the south while she
remained safe in her father’s castle at Riverrun.","['Ned', 'Riverrun']",['ned']

marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance

more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she
scarcely knew.",['Ned'],['ned']

brought his bastard home with him, and called him “son”, for all the
north to see.When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to
Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.

told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and

boy away.","['Ashara Dayne’s', 'Winterfell', 'Ned', 'Catelyn']","['ashara', 'ned', 'catelyn']"

worse.“Jon must go,”, she said now.

less the truth.","['Ned', 'Catelyn']","['ned', 'catelyn']"

Arya’s stitches were crooked again.

needlework was exquisite.Everyone said so.",['Sansa'],['sansa']

her no attention today.","['Arya', 'Septa\nMordane']",['arya']

privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, as she

along with the rest of the ladies.

a kiss.

handsome one.Sansa got to sit with him at the feast.","['Sansa', 'Jo�rey']",['sansa']
"Arya had to sit
with the little fat one.Naturally.

at Arya.“What did you think of Prince Jo�, sister?He’s very

through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.

at them, but Jon was as bad as you.",['Jon'],['jon']

come.“This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in
his horde.","['Jon Arryn', 'Robert', 'Khal Drogo']","['jon', 'robert']"

quickly, the look became annoyance.“What if I have?”,

ridge toward the barrows.",['Robert'],['robert']

Jon was cold with rage.“Look at me when I’m talking to you, boy.”,

“No.",['Jon'],['jon']
"“You’re no lordling.
Remember that.You’re a Snow, not a Stark.You’re a bastard and a

“A bully?”, Jon almost choked on the word.The accusation was so
unjust it took his breath away.","['Stark', 'Jon']",['jon']

Jon hesitated.He did feel proud when he won.Why shouldn’t he?

were doing something wrong.",['Jon'],['jon']

had broken through the clouds.He turned his back on it and lifted
his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight.

down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew

do want to know what’s on the other side, don’t you?”,

told Mormont.",['Mormont'],['mormont']

you how to defend that.”,
Alliser Thorne overheard him.“Lord Snow wants to take my place

years, Lord Stark.","['Ned', 'Stark']",['ned']

“It’s the Hand’s tourney that’s the cause of all the trouble, my
lords,”, the Commander of the City Watch complained to the king’s
council.

how it got there or who it belongs to.”,

peace, Lord Renly.","['Varys', 'Renly Baratheon', 'Dragon']","['varys', 'renly']"

not troubled himself to attend the council session, so it fell to his
Hand to speak for him.

"“The sooner this folly is done with, the
better I shall like it.”, As if the expense and trouble were not
irksome enough, all and sundry insisted on salting Ned’s wound by
calling it “the Hand’s tourney,”, as if he were the cause of it.",['Ned'],['ned']

shall be put to good use.”,

cascade of soft brown hair.","['Ned', 'Myrish']",['ned']
"Renly had seemed anxious to know if
the girl reminded him of anyone, and when Ned had no answer but
a shrug, he had seemed disappointed.The maid was Loras Tyrell’s

looked like Lyanna.","['Renly', 'Ned', 'Loras Tyrell’s', 'Margaery', 'Lyanna']","['renly', 'ned', 'loras', 'margaery', 'lyanna']"

him as more than passing queer.

he said as Jory laced the garment up the back.

egg.","['the King’s Hand', 'Ned']",['ned']
"“If you are in need of new arms for the Hand’s tourney, you

said as he �lled two matching silver goblets.",['Ned'],['ned']

green plate with the golden antlers?","['Ned', 'Hand']",['ned']

questions.",['Ned'],['ned']

back to the forge.”,
“The boy,”, Ned echoed.He had no notion who the boy might be.

darkened his jaw.“This is Gendry.Strong for his age, and he works
hard.Show the Hand that helmet you made, lad.”, Almost shyly, the

head, with two great curving horns.

unpolished but expertly shaped.",['Ned'],['ned']

pleased if you would let me buy it.”,

some beating.That helm is journeyman’s work at best.","['Ned', 'journeyman']",['ned']
"Gendry, when
Lord Arryn came to see you, what did you talk about?”,

“What sort of questions?”,
The boy shrugged.",['Gendry'],['gendry']

she looked like and all.”,

died when I was little.",['Ned'],['ned']

at me, Gendry.”, The apprentice lifted his face.Ned studied the

back to your work, lad.",['Gendry'],['gendry']

hands of his, those hands were made for hammers.He had such
promise, I took him on without a fee.”,

even on ice, but you need to be careful.",['Catelyn nodded.'],['catelyn']

been like that.",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']
"The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that
she could almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the

up than down.",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']

leather on stone.","['Mya', 'Catelyn']","['mya', 'catelyn']"

Baelish said quietly.","['Jo�rey', 'Varys']",['varys']

kindness in her clear green eyes.","['Cat', 'Sansa']",['sansa']

Sept of Baelor, before the eyes of gods and men.”,

faced it again  …  and this time the burning corpse wore Lord
Eddard’s features.",['Jon'],['jon']

clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel
seemed to �ow through the air, as if it had a will of its own.
