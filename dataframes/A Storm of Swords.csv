him saying.","['Ser Ottyn Wythers', 'Smallwood', 'King-beyond-', 'Sweet Donnel']","['ottyn', 'sweet']"

shield for no good purpose,”, but to that Thoren Smallwood said, “In

frozen on some bleak mountaintop with a wildling spear up his
bastard’s arse.The thought made him smile.","['Chett', 'Jon Snow']","['chett', 'jon']"

going to get fed.Chett had to laugh.He hadn’t fed them for three

Piggy’s throat open to let the blood come bubbling out through all
those layers of suet.","['Sam Tarly', 'Snow', 'Ser\nPiggy’s']",['sam']

Karl would have the horses ready.","['Wall', 'Sweet Donnel', 'Clubfoot\nKarl']",['sweet']

bed with some knight’s wife.","['Ollo Lophand', 'Tyrosh']",['ollo']

high as a lord there, so why shouldn’t he do the same?","['Hag’s Mire', 'Craster', 'Craster']","['craster', 'craster']"

took one look at his face, with its boils and its wen, and turned
away sickened.The worst was that slattern Bessa.",['Bessa'],['bessa']

next thing Chett had known he was walking to the Wall with that
foul-smelling black devil Yoren.","['Walder Rivers', 'Chett', 'Yoren']","['walder', 'chett', 'yoren']"
"But now he meant to take it back, and Craster’s women too.That
twisted old wildling has the right of it.If you want a woman to wife you
take her, and none of this giving her �owers so that maybe she don’t

again.
It would work, he promised himself for the hundredth time.So
long as we get away clean.","['Chett', 'hundredth']",['chett']
"Thoren Smallwood
now, he’d want to press on with the attack, but Ser Ottyn’s caution
ran too deep, and he was senior.It won’t matter anyhow.Once we’re
gone, Smallwood can attack anyone he likes.","['Thoren Smallwood', 'Smallwood']",['thoren']

"“Chett,”, said Small Paul as they trudged along a stony game trail
through sentinels and soldier pines, “what about the bird?”,
“What bloody bird?”, The last thing he needed now was some
mutton-head going on about a bird.
",['Small Paul'],['small']
"no, the risk was
too great.
“The Old Bear’s raven,”, Small Paul said.“If we kill him, who’s
going to feed his bird?”,
“Who bloody well cares?Kill the bird too if you like.”,
“I don’t want to hurt no bird,”, the big man said.",['Small Paul'],['small']
"“But that’s a
talking bird.What if it tells what we did?”,

"“Paul,”, said Chett, before the big man got too angry, “when they

won’t need no bird to tell them someone killed him.”,
Small Paul chewed on that a moment.","['Paul', 'Chett', 'Small Paul']","['chett', 'small']"
"“That’s true,”, he allowed.
“Can I keep the bird, then?I like that bird.”,
“He’s yours,”, said Chett, just to shut him up.
“We can always eat him if we get hungry,”, o�ered Lark.
","['Chett', 'Lark']","['chett', 'lark']"

Best not.”,
Chett could hear voices drifting through the trees.“Close your
bloody mouths, both of you.","['Small Paul', 'Lark', 'Chett']","['small', 'lark', 'chett']"
"Just the sight of
Samwell Tarly �lled him with anger.Stewarding for Maester
Aemon had been as good a life as he’d ever known.The old blind
man was undemanding, and Clydas had taken care of most of his
wants anyway.","['Maester\nAemon', 'Clydas']",['clydas']
"Chett’s duties were easy: cleaning the rookery, a
few �res to build, a few meals to fetch … and Aemon never once hit
him.Thinks he can just walk in and shove me out, on account of being
highborn and knowing how to read.",['Aemon'],['aemon']
"He watched from the trees as the fat boy wrestled with a
longbow as tall as he was, his red moon face screwed up with
concentration.Three arrows stood in the ground before him.",['red moon'],['red']

and it was snowing, what did they expect?”,

Snow’s.","['Grenn', 'Lord\nSnow’s']",['grenn']
"“Try to hold the bow steady, Sam.”,
“It’s heavy,”, the fat boy complained, but he pulled the second
arrow all the same.This one went high, sailing through the

last arrow, Samwell, I believe my tongue is freezing to the roof of
my mouth.”,

start bawling.","['Samwell', 'Ser Piggy', 'Chett']","['samwell', 'chett']"
"“And we all know what follows fall.Gods, but I am cold.“It’s too hard.”,
“Notch, draw, and loose,”, said Grenn.“Go on.”,
Dutifully, the fat boy plucked his �nal arrow from the earth,
notched it to his longbow, drew, and released.","['Grenn', 'Dutifully']",['grenn']
"“I hit him.”, Ser Piggy sounded shocked.
“Grenn, did you see?Edd, look, I hit him!”,
“Put it between his ribs, I’d say,”, said Grenn.
“Did I kill him?”, the fat boy wanted to know.

"Tollett shrugged.“Might have punctured a lung, if he had a lung.
Most trees don’t, as a rule.”, He took the bow from Sam’s hand.“I’ve
seen worse shots, though.","['Tollett', 'Sam']",['sam']
"Aye, and made a few.”,
Ser Piggy was beaming.To look at him you’d think he’d actually
done something.But when he saw Chett and the dogs, his smile
curled up and died squeaking.

"“You hit a tree,”, Chett said.“Let’s see how you shoot when it’s
Mance Rayder’s lads.They won’t stand there with their arms out
and their leaves rustling, oh no.","['Chett', 'Mance Rayder’s']","['chett', 'mance']"

that way for you doesn’t mean Samwell will su�er the same.”,
“What are you talking about, Tollett?”,
“The axe that split your skull.","['Samwell', 'Tollett']",['samwell']
"Is it true that half your wits leaked
out on the ground and your dogs ate them?”,
The big lout Grenn laughed, and even Samwell Tarly managed a
weak little smile.","['Grenn', 'Samwell Tarly']","['grenn', 'samwell']"
"He gave them a taste of his
boot instead, and a crack of the whip for the big ugly one that
snapped at him.Once they were tied up, he went to report.“The
prints were there like Giant said, but the dogs wouldn’t track,”, he
told Mormont in front of his big black tent.","['Giant', 'Mormont']","['giant', 'mormont']"

shaggy grey beard, and sounded as tired as he looked.","['Mormont', 'grey beard']","['mormont', 'grey']"
"“We might
all have been better for a bit of fresh meat.”, The raven on his
shoulder bobbed its head and echoed, “Meat.Meat.Meat.”,
We could cook the bloody dogs, Chett thought, but he kept his
mouth shut until the Old Bear sent him on his way.",['Chett'],['chett']
"The dogs huddled
together miserably in the hard frozen mud, and Chett was half
tempted to crawl in with them.Instead he wrapped a black wool
scarf round the lower part of his face, leaving a slit for his mouth
between the winds.",['Chett'],['chett']
"The wind was rising as the shadows lengthened.It made a high
thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall.“I hate
that sound,”, little Giant said.",['Giant'],['giant']

wailing away for milk.”,
When he �nished the circuit and returned to the dogs, he found
Lark waiting for him.“The o�cers are in the Old Bear’s tent again,
talking something �erce.”,
“That’s what they do,”, said Chett.",['Chett'],['chett']
"“They’re highborn, all but
Blane, they get drunk on words instead of wine.”,
Lark sidled closer.“Cheese-for-wits keeps going on about the
bird,”, he warned, glancing about to make certain no one was close.

"“Now he’s asking if we cached any seed for the damn thing.”,

than they needed Lark.","['Chett', 'Chett', 'Lark']","['chett', 'chett', 'lark']"

part, he’ll do his.”,
Twilight was creeping through the woods by the time he rid
himself of the Sisterman and sat down to edge his sword.","['Small Paul', 'Sisterman']",['small']

hardbread and a bowl of bean and bacon soup from Hake the cook.
“The wood’s too silent,”, the old forester was saying.",['Chett'],['chett']

“Someplace warm,”, said Chett.
Of the dozen odd brothers who sat by the �re, four were his.",['Chett'],['chett']

gave each one a hard squinty look as he ate, to see if any showed
signs of breaking.Dirk seemed calm enough, sitting silent and
sharpening his blade, the way he did every night.",['Dirk'],['dirk']

Hill was all easy japes.He had white teeth and fat red lips and
yellow locks that he wore in an artful tumble about his shoulders,

"Maybe he was
at that.Chett had no use for pretty boys, nor for bastards neither,

�relight, like so many little wet jewels.",['Maslyn'],['maslyn']
"Maslyn wasn’t eating
neither, only staring at his soup as if the smell of it was about to

eaten holes large enough for a man to hide in.

chimney.","['Jarl', 'Grigg’s', 'Errok’s']","['jarl', 'grigg', 'errok']"

sound—a sudden crack that seemed to roll along the ice, followed

chunks came spinning through the trees and rolling down the slope.

unworthy thought that perhaps he had been entertaining notions of
breaking the betrothal after the �ghting was done.

lifted Bran.","['Bran', 'Hodor', 'Reeds', 'Bran']",['hodor']

blowing so strong it lifted up Bran’s cloak and made it �ap and

feats of valor he’d performed against the Kingswood Brotherhood.

closed upon the hilt.",['Tywin'],['tywin']

sound  …  but the faint light revealed only Brienne of Tarth, her

silvery �ames shift and shimmer.",['Brienne'],['brienne']

wary, sword to hand; step, turn, and listen.Each step made a little
splash.“A cave lion?",['Brienne'],['brienne']

lives here?What lives in the darkness?”,

him in the teeth like a �st.

when he limped up beside him.

There was the wind, and horses, and something else.“A
mammoth,”, Jon said.“That was a mammoth.”,

forever.Jon could make out the faint red glimmer of distant �res
moving through the wood.",['Jon'],['jon']

Marsh had restored to working order.","['Mance', 'Horse', 'Donal Noye', 'Bowen\nMarsh']","['mance', 'donal']"

mammoths moving ponderously through the half-light, and just as
quickly lost them again.A dozen, maybe more.The barrels struck the
earth and burst.",['Jon'],['jon']

roared something in the Old Tongue, his voice an ancient thunder

more.","['Jon', 'Noye']",['jon']

mammoths, Jon saw, a hundred.

looked out over the half-mile swath of cleared land that lay
between the Wall and the edge of the forest.",['Jon'],['jon']

giants, wargs and skinchangers, mountain men, salt sea sailors, ice

the Frozen Shore, Hornfoot men with their soles like boiled leather,

echoed o� the ice like rolling thunder.

up here?Any of you ever see a mammoth climb a wall?”, He

him.","['Pyp', 'Owen']",['owen']

we hold the gate they cannot pass.They cannot pass!”, They were all
shouting then, roaring his own words back at him, waving swords
and longbows in the air as their cheeks �ushed red.",['Jon'],['jon']

standing there with a warhorn slung beneath his arm.“Brother,”, he
told him, “sound for battle.”,

blasts that meant wildlings.","['Kegs', 'Grinning', 'Kegs']","['kegs', 'kegs']"

Wall itself seemed to shudder, and the echo of those great deep-
throated moans drowned all other sound.

the giants with that ram, every bloody one of you.","['moans', 'Jon']",['jon']

command, not before.THE GIANTS AND THE RAM.I want arrows
raining on them with every step, but we’ll wait till they’re in range.

back, do you hear me?”,
“I do,”, shouted Owen the Oaf.","['GIANTS', 'Owen']",['owen']

laughed with him.The chariots and the racing horsemen on the
�anks were well ahead of the center now, he saw.",['Jon'],['jon']

not crossed a third of the half mile, yet their battle line was

closer.The skins wailed, the drums thundered, the wildling arrows
�uttered and fell.

trebuchet, and heard the creak and heavy thud as a hundred spiked
steel caltrops went spinning through the air.","['LOOSE', 'DRAW.LOOSE', 'Jon']",['jon']

screams of wounded mammoths and the booming cries of giants

with his trunk and crushing archers underfoot.Jon pulled back his
bow once more, and launched another arrow at the beast’s shaggy
back to urge him on.",['Jon'],['jon']
"“Grenn, Pyp.”,
Grenn thrust his bow aside, wrestled a barrel of oil onto its side,
and rolled it to the edge of the Wall, where Pyp hammered out the
plug that sealed it, stu�ed in a twist of cloth, and set it alight with a
torch.","['Grenn', 'Grenn', 'Pyp', 'stu�ed']","['grenn', 'grenn']"

the Wall and burst, �lling the air with shattered staves and burning
oil.","['Spare Boot', 'Jon']","['spare', 'jon']"

fall.","['Grenn', 'second', 'Kegs', 'Satin', 'Jon']","['grenn', 'kegs', 'satin', 'jon']"

nothing but look fearsome and make a lot of noise.When they break,
they break hard, Jon Snow thought as he watched them reel away.

How do you like the taste of the Dornishman’s wife?“Do we have
anyone hurt?”, he asked.

"“The bloody buggers got my leg.”, Spare Boot plucked the arrow
out and waved it above his head.“The wooden one!”,

him around in a circle, and gave him a long wet kiss right there for
all to see.","['Spare Boot', 'Owen']","['spare', 'owen']"

agony from knee to groin.",['Jon'],['jon']

to the cage.Grenn, you have the Wall.”,

do if the wildlings attack again?”,
“Stop them,”, Jon told him.

his brow.","['Grenn', 'Jon', 'Pyp']","['grenn', 'jon']"

will cook up Grenn for us?”, When he saw Jon’s face, his smile died.

hot meal, a warm bed, and something to make my leg stop hurting, he
told himself.",['Jon'],['jon']

heatedly that they ought just leave the debris there, another

Aemon for the spare key.Surprisingly, the maester himself returned
with him, and Clydas with a lantern.","['the cold iron bars', 'Maester\nAemon', 'Clydas']",['clydas']

done,”, the old man told Jon while Pyp was fumbling with the
chains.“I need to change your dressing and apply a fresh poultice,
and you will want some more dreamwine for the pain.”,
Jon nodded weakly.","['Jon', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"
"The door swung open.Pyp led them in,
followed by Clydas and the lantern.It was all Jon could do to keep
up with Maester Aemon.The ice pressed close around them, and he
could feel the cold seeping into his bones, the weight of the Wall
above his head.","['Clydas', 'Jon', 'Maester Aemon']","['clydas', 'jon']"

That’s very bad.
Then Pyp said, “There’s blood on the �oor.”,
The last twenty feet of the tunnel was where they’d fought and
died.","['Jon', 'Pyp']",['jon']
"Pyp turned aside to retch, and Jon found himself
envying Maester Aemon his blindness.
Noye and his men had been waiting within, behind a gate of
heavy iron bars like the two Pyp had just unlocked.","['Jon', 'Maester Aemon']",['jon']
"The armorer had always seemed
such a big man to Jon, but locked in the giant’s massive arms he
looked almost like a child.“The giant crushed his spine.",['Jon'],['jon']

Mighty.The king of the giants.”,

lantern back to Clydas, squeezed around the bodies and through the
twisted bars, and walked toward the daylight to see what lay
beyond the splintered door.

about to crush you.

repair the outer gate as best we can and then block up this section
of the tunnel.",['Jon'],['jon']

back before we know it.","['second', 'Wynton']",['wynton']

made a �ne one.Ten years ago he would still have been capable.

killed the Imp when he was in my power, but he tricked me.","['Lysa', 'Imp']",['lysa']

full of low cunning, that one.His sellsword slew my good Ser

that.She made o� with our uncle too.",['Catelyn'],['catelyn']

young to be a mother.",['Sansa'],['sansa']

he never touched you … How would you like to marry your cousin,
the Lord Robert?”,

pile of furs on the �oor of the warming shed.“Lord Snow,”, said
Owen, shaking his shoulder, “the dawn.”, He gave Jon a hand to
help pull him back onto his feet.","['Owen', 'Owen']","['owen', 'owen']"
"They
were all too tired for talk.Few of them ever left the Wall these
days.It took too long to ride up and down in the cage.Castle Black

few others too old or ill to �ght.

the Wall to face another day.

every man that he could see, Jon knew there were a score unseen in
the wood.The brush gave them some shelter from the elements and
hid them from the eyes of the hated crows.

of it, Jon thought.Someone has to.Three days ago, one of those
breakfast arrows had caught Red Alyn of the Rosewood in the leg.

lean out far enough.Jon had to think that it was better for them to
smile at Pyp’s jest than to brood over Alyn’s corpse.

arrows and set a half-dozen ablaze, but after that Mance started
covering them with raw hides.","['Jon', 'Mance']","['jon', 'mance']"

apiece.It was Pyp who’d started naming the scarecrows after their
missing brothers, too.","['Othell Yarwyck', 'Watt of Long Lake']","['othell', 'watt']"

the custom did seem to give his brothers heart, so Jon let the names
stand and the wagering continue.

to have a look at the foe.Even at this distance there was no
mistaking Mance Rayder’s huge white tent, sewn together from the
pelts of snow bears.","['Jon', 'Mance Rayder’s']","['jon', 'mance']"
"The Myrish lenses brought the wildlings close
enough for him to make out faces.Of Mance himself he saw no sign
this morning, but his woman Dalla was outside tending the �re,
while her sister Val milked a she-goat beside the tent.","['Myrish', 'Mance', 'Dalla', 'Val']","['mance', 'dalla', 'val']"

so big it was a wonder she could move.The child must be coming
very soon, Jon thought.He swiveled the eye east and searched
amongst the tents and trees till he found the turtle.","['Dalla', 'Jon']","['dalla', 'jon']"
"That will be
coming very soon as well.The turtle had a rounded top and eight huge wheels, and
under the hides was a stout wooden frame.When the wildlings had
begun knocking it together, Satin thought they were building a ship.
",['Satin'],['satin']
"Not far wrong.The turtle was a hull turned upside down and opened
fore and aft; a longhall on wheels.
“It’s done, isn’t it?”, asked Grenn.
“Near enough.”, Jon shoved away the eye.","['Grenn', 'Jon']","['grenn', 'jon']"
"“It will come today,
most like.Did you �ll the barrels?”,
“Every one.They froze hard during the night, Pyp checked.”,
Grenn had changed a great deal from the big, clumsy, red-necked
boy Jon had �rst befriended.","['Grenn', 'Jon']","['grenn', 'jon']"

now, though.When Jon said as much, he nodded.“I heard their
axes all night.Couldn’t sleep for all the chopping.”,
“Then go sleep now.”,
",['Jon'],['jon']
"“I don’t need—”,
“You do.I want you rested.Go on, I’m not going to let you sleep
through the �ght.”, He made himself smile.“You’re the only one
who can move those bloody barrels.”,

searching the wildling camp.","['Grenn', 'Jon']","['grenn', 'jon']"
"He
still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp, but he spied
Tormund Giantsbane and two of his sons around the turtle.The sons
were struggling with the mammoth hide while Tormund gnawed on
the roast leg of a goat and bellowed orders.","['Tormund Giantsbane', 'Tormund']","['tormund', 'tormund']"

wildling skinchanger, Varamyr Sixskins, walking through the trees
with his shadowcat dogging his heels.

robbed Jon of his appetite.","['Varamyr Sixskins', 'Mance’s', 'Jon']","['varamyr', 'mance', 'jon']"

west, from Ser Denys Mallister.Bowen Marsh had chased the
wildlings all the way to the Shadow Tower, it seemed, and then
farther, down into the gloom of the Gorge.","['Ser Denys Mallister', 'Bowen Marsh', 'the Shadow Tower', 'Gorge']","['denys', 'bowen']"

he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and won a

hundred brothers slain, among them Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser
Aladale Wynch.","['the Bridge of Skulls', 'Weeper', 'Ser Endrew Tarth', 'Ser\nAladale Wynch']","['weeper', 'endrew']"
"When he had read that, Jon had dispatched Zei to Mole’s Town on
their best horse to plead with the villagers to help man the Wall.
She never returned.When he sent Mully after her, he came back to
report the whole village deserted, even the brothel.","['Jon', 'Zei', 'Wall']","['jon', 'zei']"

had followed them, straight down the kingsroad.Maybe we should
all do the same, Jon re�ected glumly.

had a belly full of bread, bacon, onions, and cheese when he heard
Horse shout, “IT’S COMING!”,
No one needed to ask what “it”, was.",['Jon'],['jon']

sleep, he could not go on without food as well.Besides, this might be
my last meal.It might be the last meal for all of us.Nor did Jon need the
maester’s Myrish eye to see it creeping out from amongst the tents
and trees.","['Jon', 'Myrish']",['jon']
"“Turtles don’t have fur.”,
“Most of them don’t have wheels either,”, said Pyp.
“Sound the warhorn,”, Jon commanded, and Kegs blew two long
blasts, to wake Grenn and the other sleepers who’d had the watch
during the night.","['Pyp', 'Jon', 'Kegs', 'Grenn']","['jon', 'kegs', 'grenn']"
"“It doesn’t really look much like a turtle,”, Satin
commented.If the wildlings were coming, the Wall would need
every man.Gods know, we have few enough.","['Satin', 'Wall']",['satin']
"Jon looked at Pyp and
Kegs and Satin, Horse and Owen the Oaf, Tim Tangletongue, Mully,
Spare Boot, and the rest, and tried to imagine them going belly to
belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings in
the freezing darkness of that tunnel, with only a few iron bars
between them.","['Kegs', 'Satin', 'Horse', 'Owen', 'Tim Tangletongue', 'Spare Boot']","['kegs', 'satin', 'owen', 'tim', 'spare']"
"The men beneath the wood and hides would be pulling hard, Jon
knew, putting their shoulders into it, straining to keep the wheels
turning, but once the turtle was �ush against the gate they would
exchange their ropes for axes.",['Jon'],['jon']
"Even Pyp sounded tired.He looks half dead,
thought Jon, but so do we all.At least Mance was not sending his
mammoths today.Jon was glad of that.Their awesome strength
was wasted on the Wall, and their size only made them easy targets.
",['Jon'],['jon']
"They liked
the look of that turtle no more than he did.
Satin, Horse, and the others were looking to him, Jon knew,
waiting for his orders.He was so tired, he hardly knew any more.
","['Horse', 'Jon']",['jon']
"The Wall is mine, he reminded himself.“Owen, Horse, to the
catapults.Kegs, you and Spare Boot on the scorpions.The rest of
you string your bows.Fire arrows.","['Horse', 'Kegs', 'Spare Boot']","['kegs', 'spare']"
"Let’s see if we can burn it.”, It
was likely to be a futile gesture, Jon knew, but it had to be better
than standing helpless.
Jon cursed under his breath.","['Jon', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"
"“Jon, it’s still coming,”, said Owen the Oaf.
He could see that for himself.Inch by inch, yard by yard, the
turtle crept closer, rolling, rumbling and rocking as it crossed the
killing ground.",['Owen'],['owen']
"Inside, under the
ice, they would clear the loose rubble from the tunnel in a matter of
hours, and then there would be nothing to stop them but two iron
gates, a few half-frozen corpses, and whatever brothers Jon cared to
throw in their path, to �ght and die down in the dark.
",['Jon'],['jon']
"“Fie!”, he
shouted down.“I’m not in the tourney!”,
“The hides won’t burn,”, Jon said, as much to himself as to the
others.Their only hope was to try and crush the turtle when it
reached the Wall.","['Jon', 'Wall']",['jon']
"Yesterday, after he’d seen
the free folk covering the turtle with sheepskins, Jon told Grenn to
pour water into the barrels, as much as they would take.","['Jon', 'Grenn']","['jon', 'grenn']"
"For that, they needed boulders.“Grenn, Owen, Kegs, it’s time.”,
Alongside the warming shed a dozen stout oaken barrels were
lined up in a row.The water
would seep down through the crushed stone, and overnight the
whole thing would freeze solid.","['Owen', 'Kegs']","['owen', 'kegs']"
"“Why don’t
we just roll the barrels o� the way they are?”,
Jon answered, “If they crash against the Wall on the way down
they’ll burst, and loose gravel will spray everywhere.",['Jon'],['jon']
"It was the nearest thing to a
boulder they were going to get.
“Why do we need to freeze it?”, Grenn had asked him.We don’t
want to rain pebbles on the whoresons.”,
He put his shoulder to the one barrel with Grenn, while Kegs and
Owen were wrestling with another.","['Grenn', 'Grenn', 'Kegs', 'Owen']","['grenn', 'grenn', 'kegs', 'owen']"
"Together they rocked it back
and forth to break the grip of the ice that had formed around its
bottom.“The bugger weighs a ton,”, said Grenn.
“Tip it over and roll it,”, Jon said.","['Grenn', 'Jon']","['grenn', 'jon']"
"“Careful, if it rolls over your
foot you’ll end up like Spare Boot.”,
Once the barrel was on its side, Jon grabbed a torch and waved it
above the surface of the Wall, back and forth, just enough to melt
the ice a little.","['Spare Boot', 'Jon']","['spare', 'jon']"
"They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by
the time Pyp shouted, “There’s a turtle at our door!”, Jon braced his
injured leg and leaned out for a look.",['Jon'],['jon']
"Horse and Mully
were dropping rocks down on them, and Jon thought he saw one
man go down, but the stones were too small to have any e�ect on
the turtle itself.","['Mully', 'Jon']","['mully', 'jon']"
"“You shouldn’t lean out like that,”, the boy said.
“We should have built hoardings.”, Jon thought he could hear the
crash of axes on wood, but that was probably just fear ringing in his
ears.",['Jon'],['jon']
"He looked to Grenn.“Do it.”,
Grenn got behind a barrel, put his shoulder against it, grunted,
and began to push.Owen and Mully moved to help him.They
shoved the barrel out a foot, and then another.","['Grenn', 'Grenn', 'Owen', 'Mully']","['grenn', 'grenn', 'owen', 'mully']"
"Look at them hop away!”,
“Again,”, Jon barked, and Grenn and Kegs slammed their shoulders
against the next barrel, and sent it tottering out into empty air.
","['Jon', 'Grenn', 'Kegs']","['jon', 'grenn', 'kegs']"
"By the time they were done, the front of Mance’s turtle was a
crushed and splintered ruin, and wildlings were spilling out the
other end and scrambling for their camp.",['Mance’s'],['mance']
"And suddenly it was
gone.
Satin whooped and Owen the Oaf
danced in circles, while Pyp leaned out and called, “The turtle was
stu�ed full of rabbits!Satin scooped up his
crossbow and sent a few quarrels after them as they ran, to see
them o� the faster.","['Satin', 'Owen', 'Pyp', 'rabbits!Satin']","['satin', 'owen']"

making japes, and none of them would die today.

barrels of gravel remained where twelve had stood a few moments
before.","['Grenn', 'Pyp']",['grenn']

going down to the King’s Tower,”, he told them.“Call me if Mance

them said brusquely, “pull on your boots and come with us.”,

whilst he slept, that Mance Rayder had sent more giants or another
turtle and broken through the gate.","['Jon Snow', 'Mance Rayder']","['jon', 'mance']"

saw that the strangers were all in black.They’re men of the Night’s

bed.","['Jon', 'Jon']","['jon', 'jon']"

in to stab at back and belly.","['Clegane', 'Mountain', 'Tickler']","['clegane', 'tickler']"

blood long enough to undo his swordbelt.",['Arya'],['arya']
