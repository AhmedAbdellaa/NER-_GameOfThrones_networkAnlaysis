"PROLOGUE
Dragons,”, said Mollander.He snatched a withered apple o� the
ground and tossed it hand to hand.
“Throw the apple,”, urged Alleras the Sphinx.","['Mollander', 'Sphinx']",['mollander']
"He slipped an arrow
from his quiver and nocked it to his bowstring.
“I should like to see a dragon.”, Roone was the youngest of them,
a chunky boy still two years shy of manhood.",['Roone'],['roone']
"“I should like that
very much.”,
And I should like to sleep with Rosey’s arms around me, Pate
thought.He shifted restlessly on the bench.By the morrow the girl
could well be his.","['Rosey', 'Pate']","['rosey', 'pate']"
"I will take her far from Oldtown, across the narrow
sea to one of the Free Cities.There were no maesters there, no one to
accuse him.
He could hear Emma’s laughter coming through a shuttered
window overhead, mingled with the deeper voice of the man she
was entertaining.","['Oldtown', 'the Free Cities', 'Emma']",['emma']
"She was the oldest of the serving wenches at the
Quill and Tankard, forty if she was a day, but still pretty in a �eshy
sort of way.Rosey was her daughter, �fteen and freshly �owered.
","['Tankard', 'Rosey']",['rosey']
"Emma had decreed that Rosey’s maidenhead would cost a golden
dragon.Pate had saved nine silver stags and a pot of copper stars
and pennies, for all the good that would do him.","['Emma', 'Rosey']","['emma', 'rosey']"
"He would have
stood a better chance of hatching a real dragon than saving up
enough coin to make a golden one.
“You were born too late for dragons, lad,”, Armen the Acolyte told
Roone.",['Armen the Acolyte'],['armen']
"“The last one perished during the reign
of King Aegon the Third.”,
“The last dragon in Westeros,”, insisted Mollander.
“Throw the apple,”, Alleras urged again.","['King Aegon', 'Third', 'Westeros', 'Mollander']","['aegon', 'mollander']"
"He was a comely youth,
their Sphinx.All the serving wenches doted on him.Even Rosey
would sometimes touch him on the arm when she brought him
wine, and Pate had to gnash his teeth and pretend not to see.
","['Sphinx', 'Rosey', 'Pate']","['rosey', 'pate']"
"“Unless you mean to eat it.”,
“Here.”, Dragging his clubfoot, Mollander took a short hop,
whirled, and whipped the apple sidearm into the mists that hung
above the Honeywine.","['Mollander', 'Honeywine']",['mollander']
"“The last dragon in Westeros was the last dragon,”, said Armen
doggedly.“That is well known.”,
“The apple,”, Alleras said.If not for his foot, he would have been a
knight like his father.","['Westeros', 'Alleras']",['alleras']
"Pate did not see
the arrow catch the apple, but he heard it.A soft chunk echoed back
across the river, followed by a splash.
Mollander whistled.“You cored it.",['Mollander'],['mollander']
"Sweet.”,
Not half as sweet as Rosey.Pate loved her hazel eyes and budding
breasts, and the way she smiled every time she saw him.He loved
the dimples in her cheeks.",['Rosey'],['rosey']
"He could buy a donkey with the coin he’d saved, and he and
Rosey could take turns riding it as they wandered Westeros.Ebrose
might not think him worthy of the silver, but Pate knew how to set
","['Rosey', 'Westeros', 'Pate']","['rosey', 'pate']"
"a bone and leech a fever.The smallfolk would be grateful for his
help.If he could learn to cut hair and shave beards, he might even
be a barber.That would be enough, he told himself, so long as I had
Rosey.",['Rosey'],['rosey']
"Rosey was all that he wanted in the world.
That had not always been so.How high he’d ride, how nobly, smiling
down at the smallfolk when he passed them on the road … 
",['Rosey'],['rosey']
"One night in the Quill and Tankard’s common room, after his
second tankard of fearsomely strong cider, Pate had boasted that he
would not always be a novice.","['Tankard’s', 'second', 'Pate']",['pate']
"Everyone said that
Walgrave had forgotten more of ravencraft than most maesters ever
knew, so Pate assumed a black iron link was the least that he could
hope for, only to �nd that Walgrave could not grant him one.","['Walgrave', 'Pate', 'Walgrave']","['walgrave', 'pate', 'walgrave']"
"Maester Gormon sat below the iron mask in Walgrave’s
place, the same Gormon who had once accused Pate of theft.
In the apple tree beside the water, a nightingale began to sing.","['Maester Gormon', 'Walgrave’s', 'Gormon']","['walgrave', 'gormon']"
"Perhaps it was the fearsomely strong cider—he had not come
here to drink, but Alleras had been buying to celebrate his copper
link, and guilt had made him thirsty—but it almost sounded as if the
nightingale were trilling gold for iron, gold for iron, gold for iron.
",['Alleras'],['alleras']
"The big white birds were Archmaester
Walgrave’s pride.He wanted them to eat him when he died, but
Pate half suspected that they meant to eat him too.
Which was passing strange, because that was what the stranger had
said the night Rosey brought the two of them together.","['Archmaester\nWalgrave’s', 'Pate half', 'Rosey']","['pate', 'rosey']"
"“Who are
you?”, Pate had demanded of him, and the man had replied, “An
alchemist.I can change iron into gold.”,And then the coin was in his
hand, dancing across his knuckles, the soft yellow gold shining in
the candlelight.",['Pate'],['pate']
"On one side was a three-headed dragon, on the
other the head of some dead king.Gold for iron, Pate remembered,
you won’t do better.Do you want her?Do you love her?",['Pate'],['pate']
"Pate had returned to the Quill and
Tankard, still uncertain what he was, but instead of the alchemist
he’d found Mollander and Armen and the Sphinx, with Roone in
tow.","['Mollander', 'Armen', 'Sphinx']","['mollander', 'armen']"
"Though the tall, timbered building
leaned toward the south the way novices sometimes leaned after a
tankard, Pate expected that the inn would go on standing for
another six hundred years, selling wine and ale and fearsomely
strong cider to rivermen and seamen, smiths and singers, priests and
princes, and the novices and acolytes of the Citadel.
","['Pate', 'Citadel']",['pate']
"“Oldtown is not the world,”, declared Mollander, too loudly.He
was a knight’s son, and drunk as drunk could be.Since they brought
him word of his father’s death upon the Blackwater, he got drunk
most every night.",['Mollander'],['mollander']
"Even in Oldtown, far from the �ghting and safe
behind its walls, the War of the Five Kings had touched them
all … although Archmaester Benedict insisted that there had never
been a war of �ve kings, since Renly Baratheon had been slain
before Balon Greyjoy had crowned himself.
","['Oldtown', 'the War of the Five Kings', 'Archmaester Benedict', 'Renly Baratheon', 'Balon Greyjoy']","['renly', 'balon']"
"“My father always said the world was bigger than any lord’s
castle,”, Mollander went on.“Dragons must be the least of the things
a man might �nd in Qarth and Asshai and Yi Ti.","['Mollander', 'Qarth', 'Asshai', 'Yi Ti']",['mollander']
"Go back down to the docks, and I wager you’ll �nd
sailors who’ll tell you of the mermaids that they bedded, or how
they spent a year in the belly of a �sh.”,
“How do you know they didn’t?”, Mollander thumped through the
grass, looking for more apples.",['Mollander'],['mollander']
"These sailors’
stories …”,
“…  are stories told by sailors,”, Armen interrupted.“Sailors, my
dear Mollander.“You’d need to be down the belly
yourself to swear they weren’t.","['Armen', 'Mollander']","['armen', 'mollander']"
"One sailor with a story, aye, a man
might laugh at that, but when oarsmen o� four di�erent ships tell
the same tale in four di�erent tongues …”,
“The tales are not the same,”, insisted Armen.",['Armen'],['armen']
"“Dragons in Asshai,
dragons in Qarth, dragons in Meereen, Dothraki dragons, dragons
freeing slaves … each telling di�ers from the last.”,
“Only in details.”, Mollander grew more stubborn when he drank,
and even when sober he was bullheaded.","['Asshai', 'Qarth', 'Meereen', 'Dothraki', 'Mollander']",['mollander']
"“There’s another apple near your foot,”, Alleras called to
Mollander, “and I still have two arrows in my quiver.”,
“Fuck your quiver.”, Mollander scooped up the windfall.","['Alleras', 'Mollander', 'Mollander']","['alleras', 'mollander', 'mollander']"
"One
half landed on a turret roof, tumbled to a lower roof, bounced, and
missed Armen by a foot.“If you cut a worm in two, you make two
worms,”, the acolyte informed them.
",['Armen'],['armen']
"“If only it worked that way with apples, no one would ever need
go hungry,”, said Alleras with one of his soft smiles.The Sphinx was
always smiling, as if he knew some secret jape.","['Alleras', 'Sphinx']",['alleras']
"It gave him a
wicked look that went well with his pointed chin, widow’s peak,
and dense mat of close-cropped jet-black curls.
Alleras would make a maester.",['Alleras'],['alleras']
"Still, he would make a maester too.Roone and
Mollander remained pink-necked novices, but Roone was very
young and Mollander preferred drinking to reading.
","['Mollander', 'Roone', 'Mollander']","['mollander', 'roone', 'mollander']"
"This
time he submitted himself to kindly old Archmaester Ebrose,
renowned for his soft voice and gentle hands, but Ebrose’s sighs had
somehow proved just as painful as Vaellyn’s barbs.
","['Archmaester Ebrose', 'Vaellyn']",['vaellyn']
"“One last apple,”, promised Alleras, “and I will tell you what I
suspect about these dragons.”,
“What could you know that I don’t?”, grumbled Mollander.","['Alleras', 'Mollander']","['alleras', 'mollander']"
"It
took Pate two years to summon up the courage to try again.He
spied an apple on a branch, jumped up, pulled it down, and threw.
Alleras drew his bowstring back to his ear, turning gracefully to
follow the target in �ight.","['Pate', 'Alleras']","['pate', 'alleras']"
"He loosed his shaft just as the apple
began to fall.
“You always miss your last shot,”, said Roone.
The apple splashed down into the river, untouched.
",['Roone'],['roone']
"“See?”, said Roone.
“The day you make them all is the day you stop improving.”,
Alleras unstrung his longbow and eased it into its leather case.The
bow was carved from goldenheart, a rare and fabled wood from the
Summer Isles.","['Roone', 'Alleras', 'Summer Isles']","['roone', 'alleras']"
"Pate had tried to bend it once, and failed.The Sphinx
looks slight, but there’s strength in those slim arms, he re�ected, as
Alleras threw a leg across the bench and reached for his wine cup.
","['Sphinx', 'Alleras']",['alleras']
"“The dragon has three heads,”, he announced in his soft Dornish
drawl.
“Is this a riddle?”, Roone wanted to know.“Sphinxes always speak
in riddles in the tales.”,
“No riddle.”, Alleras sipped his wine.","['Dornish', 'Roone', 'Alleras']","['dornish', 'roone', 'alleras']"
"Even in Oldtown such wines did not
come cheap.
Alleras was the same: his father was a
Dornishman, his mother a black-skinned Summer Islander.His own
skin was dark as teak.","['Oldtown', 'Alleras', 'Dornishman', 'Summer Islander']",['alleras']
"And like the green marble sphinxes that
�anked the Citadel’s main gate, Alleras had eyes of onyx.
“No dragon has ever had three heads except on shields and
banners,”, Armen the Acolyte said �rmly.","['Citadel', 'Alleras', 'Armen the Acolyte']","['alleras', 'armen']"
"“That was a heraldic
charge, no more.Furthermore, the Targaryens are all dead.”,
“Not all,”, said Alleras.“The Beggar King had a sister.”,
“I thought her head was smashed against a wall,”, said Roone.
","['Targaryens', 'Alleras', 'Beggar King', 'Roone']","['alleras', 'roone']"
"“No,”, said Alleras.“It was Prince Rhaegar’s young son Aegon
whose head was dashed against the wall by the Lion of Lannister’s
brave men.We speak of Rhaegar’s sister, born on Dragonstone
before its fall.","['Alleras', 'Prince Rhaegar’s', 'Aegon', 'the Lion of Lannister’s', 'Rhaegar']","['alleras', 'rhaegar', 'aegon', 'rhaegar']"
"The one they called Daenerys.”,
“The Stormborn.I recall her now.”, Mollander lifted his tankard
high, sloshing the cider that remained.“Here’s to her!”, He gulped,
slammed his empty tankard down, belched, and wiped his mouth
with the back of his hand.","['Daenerys', 'Mollander']","['daenerys', 'mollander']"
"“I always knew you were a traitor, Hopfrog.”, Lazy Leo was
slouching by the foot of the old plank bridge, draped in satin striped
in green and gold, with a black silk half cape pinned to his shoulder
by a rose of jade.","['Hopfrog', 'Lazy Leo', 'satin']",['satin']
"A lock of his ash-
blond hair fell down across one eye.
Mollander bristled at the sight of him.“Bugger that.Go away.
You are not welcome here.”, Alleras laid a hand upon his arm to
calm him, whilst Armen frowned.","['Mollander', 'Alleras', 'Armen']","['mollander', 'alleras', 'armen']"
"“Leo.My lord.I had understood
that you were still con�ned to the Citadel for …”,
“…  three more days.”, Lazy Leo shrugged.“Perestan says the
world is forty thousand years old.","['Leo', 'Lazy Leo']",['leo']
"Mollos says �ve hundred
thousand.What are three days, I ask you?”, Though there were a
dozen empty tables on the terrace, Leo sat himself at theirs.“Buy
me a cup of Arbor gold, Hopfrog, and perhaps I won’t inform my
father of your toast.","['Mollos', 'Leo', 'Arbor', 'Hopfrog']","['mollos', 'leo']"
"A man must eat.
What did you lads have?”,
“Mutton,”, muttered Mollander.He sounded none too pleased
about it.“We shared a haunch of boiled mutton.”,
“I’m certain it was �lling.”, Leo turned to Alleras.","['Mollander', 'Leo', 'Alleras']","['mollander', 'leo', 'alleras']"
"“A lord’s son
should be open-handed, Sphinx.I understand you won your copper
link.I’ll drink to that.”,
Alleras smiled back at him.“I only buy for friends.","['Sphinx', 'Alleras']",['alleras']
"And I am no
lord’s son, I’ve told you that.My mother was a trader.”,
Leo’s eyes were hazel, bright with wine and malice.“Your mother
was a monkey from the Summer Isles.","['Leo’s', 'the Summer Isles']",['leo']
"The Dornish will fuck
anything with a hole between its legs.Meaning no o�ense.You may
be brown as a nut, but at least you bathe.Unlike our spotted pig
boy.”, He waved a hand toward Pate.
",['Dornish'],['dornish']
"Somehow his stupidity would turn
out to have been a sort of uncouth cunning; the tales always ended
with Spotted Pate sitting on a lord’s high seat or bedding some
knight’s daughter.",['Spotted Pate'],['spotted']
"Pate sometimes thought his mother must have
hated him to have named him as she did.
Alleras was no longer smiling.“You will apologize.”,
“Will I?”, said Leo.","['Alleras', 'Leo']","['alleras', 'leo']"
"“How can I, with my throat so dry …”,
“You shame your House with every word you say,”, Alleras told
him.“You shame the Citadel by being one of us.”,
“I know.","['House', 'Alleras']",['alleras']
"So buy me some wine, that I might drown my shame.”,
Mollander said, “I would tear your tongue out by the roots.”,
“Truly?Then how would I tell you about the dragons?”, Leo
shrugged again.","['Mollander', 'Leo']","['mollander', 'leo']"
"“The mongrel has the right of it.The Mad King’s
daughter is alive, and she’s hatched herself three dragons.”,
“Three?”, said Roone, astonished.
Leo patted his hand.","['The Mad King’s', 'Roone', 'Leo']","['roone', 'leo']"
"“More than two and less than four.I would
not try for my golden link just yet if I were you.”,
“You leave him be,”, warned Mollander.
“Such a chivalrous Hopfrog.","['Mollander', 'Hopfrog']",['mollander']
"“The sea is wet, the sun is warm, and the menagerie
hates the masti�.”,
He has a mocking name for everyone, thought Pate, but he could
not deny that Marwyn looked more a masti� than a maester.","['menagerie', 'Marwyn']",['marwyn']
",
“Archmaester Ryam says so too,”, said Roone.
Leo yawned.As if
he wants to bite you.The Mage was not like other maesters.Men spoke of seeing him down in the
undercity, in rat pits and black brothels, consorting with mummers,
","['Roone', 'Leo', 'Mage']","['roone', 'leo']"
"When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown, after spending eight
years in the east mapping distant lands, searching for lost books,
and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders, Vinegar Vaellyn
had dubbed him “Marwyn the Mage.”, The name was soon all over
Oldtown, to Vaellyn’s vast annoyance.","['Marwyn', 'Oldtown', 'Vinegar Vaellyn', 'Oldtown', 'Vaellyn']","['marwyn', 'vaellyn']"
"“Leave spells and prayers to
priests and septons and bend your wits to learning truths a man can
trust in,”, Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pate, but Ryam’s
ring and rod and mask were yellow gold, and his maester’s chain
had no link of Valyrian steel.
","['Archmaester Ryam', 'Ryam', 'Valyrian']",['ryam']
"“Archmaester Marwyn believes in
many curious things,”, he said, “but he has no more proof of dragons
than Mollander.Just more sailors’ stories.”,
“You’re wrong,”, said Leo.","['Archmaester Marwyn', 'Mollander', 'Leo']","['mollander', 'leo']"
"The Sphinx studied Leo with his
big black eyes.Roone looked lost.
Pate knew about the glass candles, though he had never seen one
burn.They were the worst-kept secret of the Citadel.","['Sphinx', 'Leo', 'Citadel']",['leo']
"“What are these glass candles?”, asked Roone.
Armen the Acolyte cleared his throat.“The night before an
acolyte says his vows, he must stand a vigil in the vault.","['Roone', 'Acolyte']",['roone']
"Then, with bloody hands, they must wait upon the
dawn, brooding on their failure.Wiser men simply go to sleep, or
spend their night in prayer, but every year there are always a few
who must try.”,
“Yes.”, Pate had heard the same stories.",['Pate'],['pate']
"“But what’s the use of a
candle that casts no light?”,
“It is a lesson,”, Armen said, “the last lesson we must learn before
we don our maester’s chains.","['Armen', 'maester’s']",['armen']
"The glass candle reminds us of
that as well.“Not possible for you, you mean.I
saw the candle burning with my own eyes.”,
“You saw some candle burning, I don’t doubt,”, said Armen.",['Armen'],['armen']
"“Obsidian does not burn.”,
“Dragonglass,”, Pate said.“The smallfolk call it dragonglass.”,
Somehow that seemed important.
“They do,”, mused Alleras, the Sphinx, “and if there are dragons in
the world again …”,
“Dragons and darker things,”, said Leo.","['Obsidian', 'Pate', 'Alleras', 'Sphinx', 'Leo']","['pate', 'alleras', 'leo']"
"“That’s worth a round, I’d say.”,
“We’ve drunk enough,”, said Armen.“Morn will be upon us sooner
than we’d like, and Archmaester Ebrose will be speaking on the
","['Armen', 'Archmaester Ebrose']",['armen']
"properties of urine.Those who mean to forge a silver link would do
well not to miss his talk.”,
“Far be it from me to keep you from the piss tasting,”, said Leo.
",['Leo'],['leo']
"“Myself, I prefer the taste of Arbor gold.”,
“If the choice is piss or you, I’ll drink piss.”, Mollander pushed
back from the table.“Come, Roone.”,
The Sphinx reached for his bowcase.","['Arbor', 'Mollander', 'Roone', 'Sphinx']","['mollander', 'roone']"
"“It’s bed for me as well.I
expect I’ll dream of dragons and glass candles.”,
“All of you?”, Leo shrugged.“Well, Rosey will remain.Perhaps I’ll
wake our little sweetmeat and make a woman of her.”,
Alleras saw the look on Pate’s face.","['Leo', 'Rosey', 'Alleras']","['leo', 'rosey', 'alleras']"
"“If he does not have a copper
for a cup of wine, he cannot have a dragon for the girl.”,
“Aye,”, said Mollander.“Besides, it takes a man to make a woman.
Come with us, Pate.","['Mollander', 'Pate']","['mollander', 'pate']"
"Some days he seemed to think Pate was someone named
Cressen.“Not just yet,”, he told his friends.“I’m going to stay
awhile.”, Dawn had not broken, not quite.","['Pate', 'Cressen', 'Dawn']","['pate', 'cressen']"
"The alchemist might still
be coming, and Pate meant to be here if he did.
“As you wish,”, said Armen.Alleras gave Pate a lingering look,
then slung his bow over one slim shoulder and followed the others
toward the bridge.","['Pate', 'Armen']","['pate', 'armen']"
"“Careful,”, Pate
heard Armen say as the river mists swallowed up the four of them,
“the night is damp, and the cobbles will be slippery.”,
When they were gone, Lazy Leo considered Pate sourly across the
table.","['Armen', 'Lazy Leo']",['armen']
"“How is our lovely little Rosey, pray?”,
“She’s sleeping,”, Pate said curtly.
“Naked, I don’t doubt.”, Leo grinned.“Do you think she’s truly
worth a dragon?","['Rosey', 'Pate', 'Leo']","['rosey', 'pate', 'leo']"
"One day I suppose I must �nd out.”,
Pate knew better than to reply to that.
Leo needed no reply.“I expect that once I’ve broken in the
wench, her price will fall to where even pig boys will be able to
a�",['Leo'],['leo']
"ordher.You ought to thank me.”,
I ought to kill you, Pate thought, but he was not near drunk
enough to throw away his life.Leo had been trained to arms, and
was known to be deadly with bravo’s blade and dagger.","['Pate', 'Leo', 'bravo’s']","['pate', 'leo']"
"And if Pate
should somehow kill him, it would mean his own head too.Leo had
two names where Pate had only one, and his second was Tyrell.Ser
Moryn Tyrell, commander of the City Watch of Oldtown, was Leo’s
father.","['Leo', 'Pate', 'second', 'Tyrell', 'Moryn Tyrell', 'the City Watch of Oldtown', 'Leo’s']","['leo', 'pate', 'moryn', 'leo']"

has come, and the alchemist has not.He did not know whether he
should laugh or cry.Am I still a thief if I put it all back and no one ever
knows?",['Pate'],['pate']

that Ebrose and Vaellyn had once asked him.
When he pushed back from the bench and got to his feet, the
fearsomely strong cider all went to his head at once.",['Vaellyn'],['vaellyn']

days would be spent listening to ravens quork and scrubbing shit

lobstered steel.",['Pate'],['pate']

"“Ser?My lady?”, said Podrick.“There’s a rider.”,
“Where?”, None of the rocks suggested a rider to her.
“On the road.Not a rock rider.A real rider.Following us.","['Ser?My', 'Podrick']",['podrick']
"Down
there.”, He pointed.
Brienne twisted in her saddle.They had climbed high enough to
see for leagues along the shore.The horse was coming up the same
road they had taken, two or three miles behind them.",['Brienne'],['brienne']
"Again?She
glanced at Nimble Dick suspiciously.
“Don’t squint at me,”, Crabb said.“He’s naught t’ do with old
Nimble Dick, whoever he is.Some man o’ Brune’s, most like, come
back from the wars.","['Dick', 'Crabb', 'Brune’s']",['dick']

bloody certain.Their sort don’t ride horses.”,
“No,”, said Brienne.",['Brienne'],['brienne']

much to Nimble Dick.

sons and grandsons went o� to the wars.","['Brienne', 'Dick']","['brienne', 'dick']"
"“You speak of Lord Brune

ragged patch of darker fabric showed where some badge had been
torn away.","['Brune', 'Dick']",['dick']
"Even a wench can wind a bloody

beyond the castle, with their wooded slopes.“No more roads from
here on, only streams and game trails, but m’lady need not fear.

the rider here, with her blade in hand.",['Brienne'],['brienne']

mare through the green gloom, weaving in and out amongst the
trees.It would be very easy to get lost here, she realized.",['Brienne'],['brienne']
"After a little while he stopped.
“It’s bad here,”, Podrick said.“This is a bad place.”,

wood is a gloomy place, but in the end it’s just a wood.","['Podrick', 'Brienne']","['podrick', 'brienne']"

naught here that we need fear.”,

taking them.","['Podrick', 'Brienne', 'Dick']","['podrick', 'brienne', 'dick']"

come so far.",['Brienne'],['brienne']

was standing underneath the weirwood.He looked up and saw the

it hard and low, and one of Crabb’s knees exploded in a spray of

it down in the middle of Crabb’s face.","['Dick', 'Shagwell', 'Crabb']","['dick', 'shagwell']"

“I’m a fool,”, Shagwell announced happily.

making for Riverrun, and he stole her.","['Brienne', 'Stark', 'Riverrun']",['brienne']

for her too.","['Riverrun', 'Brienne', 'Riverrun', 'Beric’s']","['brienne', 'beric']"
