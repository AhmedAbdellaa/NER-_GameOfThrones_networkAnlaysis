that terrible color, the color of blood and �ame and sunsets.",['Cressen'],['cressen']

all mean?he wanted to cry.
“Maester Cressen, we have visitors.”, Pylos spoke softly, as if
loath to disturb Cressen’s solemn meditations.","['Maester Cressen', 'Pylos', 'Cressen']","['pylos', 'cressen']"

drivel �lled his head, he would have shouted.“The princess would
see the white raven.”, Ever correct, Pylos called her princess now, as
her lord father was a king.",['Pylos'],['pylos']

Taking his arm, Pylos led him inside.In his youth, Cressen had
walked briskly, but he was not far from his eightieth name day
now, and his legs were frail and unsteady.","['Pylos', 'Cressen', 'eightieth']","['pylos', 'cressen']"

year when he took ill, the Citadel had sent Pylos out from Oldtown,
mere days before Lord Stannis had closed the isle … to help him in
his labors, it was said, but Cressen knew the truth.","['Citadel', 'Pylos', 'Oldtown', 'Cressen']","['pylos', 'cressen']"
"Two years past, he had
fallen and shattered a hip, and it had never mended properly.Pylos had come
to replace him when he died.He did not mind.Someone must take
his place, and sooner than he would like …
He let the younger man settle him behind his books and papers.

"And
how they trembled, these hands of his that had once been so sure
and deft …
When Pylos returned the girl came with him, shy as ever.Behind
her, shu�ing and hopping in that queer sideways walk of his, came
her fool.",['Pylos'],['pylos']
"“Who comes to see us so early, Pylos?”, Cressen said.
“It’s me and Patches, Maester.”, Guileless blue eyes blinked at
him.Hers was not a pretty face, alas.","['Pylos', 'Cressen', 'Patches', 'Maester.']","['pylos', 'cressen']"
"Across half one cheek and well
down her neck, her �esh was sti� and dead, the skin cracked and
�aking, mottled black and grey and stony to the touch.“Pylos said
we might see the white raven.”,
“Indeed you may,”, Cressen answered.",['Cressen'],['cressen']
"As if he would ever deny
her.She had been denied too often in her time.Her name was
Shireen.She would be ten on her next name day, and she was the
saddest child that Maester Cressen had ever known.","['Shireen', 'Maester Cressen']",['shireen']
"“Maester
Pylos, do me a kindness and bring the bird down from the rookery
for the Lady Shireen.”,
“It would be my pleasure.”, Pylos was a polite youth, no more
than �ve-and-twenty, yet solemn as a man of sixty.","['the Lady Shireen', 'Pylos']",['pylos']
"Her sadness is
my shame, the old man thought, another mark of my failure.If only he had
more humor, more life in him; that was what was needed here.A maester must go where he is sent, so Cressen had come here
with his lord some twelve years past, and he had served, and served
well.",['Cressen'],['cressen']
"The fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch Pylos
climb the steep iron steps to the rookery.His bells rang with the
motion.“Under the sea, the birds have scales for feathers,”, he said,
clang-a-langing.",['Pylos'],['pylos']
"“I know, I know, oh,oh, oh.”,
Even for a fool, Patchface was a sorry thing.Perhaps once he
could evoke gales of laughter with a quip, but the sea had taken
that power from him, along with half his wits and all his memory.

there is a tale to make men weep.“Sit with me, child.”, Cressen
beckoned her closer.",['Cressen'],['cressen']
"“This is early to come calling, scarce past
dawn.You should be snug in your bed.”,
“I had bad dreams,”, Shireen told him.“About the dragons.They
were coming to eat me.”,
The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester
Cressen could recall.",['Shireen'],['shireen']

Shireen was unconvinced.“What about the thing in the sky?Dalla
and Matrice were talking by the well, and Dalla said she heard the
red woman tell Mother that it was dragonsbreath.","['Shireen', 'Matrice', 'Dalla']","['shireen', 'matrice', 'dalla']"

sweet child.A star with a tail, lost in the heavens.",['Dalla'],['dalla']

soon enough, never to be seen again in our lifetimes.Watch and
see.”,
Shireen gave a brave little nod.“Mother said the white raven
means it’s not summer anymore.”",['Shireen'],['shireen']
"The white ravens �y only from the Citadel.”,
Cressen’s �ngers went to the chain about his neck, each link forged
from a di�erent metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another
branch of learning; the maester’s collar, mark of his order.","['Citadel', 'Cressen']",['cressen']
"Ten years,
two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living
memory.”,
“Will it get cold now?”, Shireen was a summer child, and had
never known true cold.
",['Shireen'],['shireen']
"“In time,”, Cressen replied.Patchface rang his bells.“It is always summer under the sea,”, he
intoned.“The merwives wear nennymoans in their hair and weave
gowns of silver seaweed.",['Cressen'],['cressen']
"I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.”,
Shireen giggled.“I should like a gown of silver seaweed.”,
“Under the sea, it snows up,”, said the fool, “and the rain is dry as
bone.",['Shireen'],['shireen']
"I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.”,
“Will it truly snow?”, the child asked.
“It will,”, Cressen said.But not for years yet, I pray, and then not for
long.“Ah, here is Pylos with the bird.”,
Shireen gave a cry of delight.","['Cressen', 'Pylos', 'Shireen']","['cressen', 'pylos', 'shireen']"
"Even Cressen had to admit the bird
made an impressive sight, white as snow and larger than any hawk,
with the bright black eyes that meant it was no mere albino, but a
truebred white raven of the Citadel.","['Cressen', 'Citadel']",['cressen']
"“Here,”, he called.The raven
spread its wings, leapt into the air, and �apped noisily across the
room to land on the table beside him.

"“It talks!”,
“A few words.As I said, they are clever, these birds.”,
“Clever bird, clever man, clever clever fool,”, said Patchface,
jangling.“Oh, clever clever clever fool.”, He began to sing.",['Patchface'],['patchface']
"I told him to stop but he won’t.
It makes me scared.Make him stop.”,

silenced him forever, but now …

return home from his fruitless mission.","['Ste�', 'Volantis', 'Cressen']",['cressen']

those years.","['Patchface', 'Ser Harbert', 'Storm’s End']","['patchface', 'harbert']"

refused, and in the end he had won.",['Cressen'],['cressen']
"Whether Patchface had gotten
any joy of that victory he could not say, not even today, so many

and clatter.",['Patchface'],['patchface']

must speak with your lord father.","['Cressen', 'Shireen’s']","['cressen', 'shireen']"
"There
are too many steps in this castle, and it seems to me they add a few
every night, just to vex me.”,

steps than Cressen cared to contemplate.",['Cressen'],['cressen']

two at a time; for old men with bad hips, every one was a torment.

within.“It’s best I see him alone.”,

made excuses, some promises, some only lied.”, He shrugged.",['Ser Davos'],['davos']

Wex drove his heel into the mud, and pivoted his foot this way

beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk south, it was young Lord

knocked the bastard blade from Jon’s hand, and sent him staggering

a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but
the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease.",['Jon'],['jon']

forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth’s quickness against
the savage strength of Qhorin’s left-hand cuts.Already he could feel his arms growing numb.

away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon’s slash had not touched
